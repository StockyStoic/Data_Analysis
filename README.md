# Data_Analysis
Two projects that I did while taking the Data Quest data analysis course. 

One of the projects involved building a spam classifier based off the Naive-Bayes approach. 

The second project involved understanding the effects of varying hyperparameters on the accuracy of a K-Nearest Neughbours prediction
