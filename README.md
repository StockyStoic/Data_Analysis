Few data anylsis projects i have performed. 

One of the projects involved building a spam classifier based off the Naive-Bayes approach. 

The second project involved understanding the effects of varying hyperparameters on the accuracy of a K-Nearest Neughbours prediction

The third project is a simple application of an embedding vector for a sentiment classification problem
