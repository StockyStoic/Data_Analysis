# Data_Analysis
Few data anylsis projects I have performed. 

One of the projects is a simple application of an embedding vector for a sentiment classification problem

The second project involved understanding the effects of varying hyperparameters on the accuracy of a K-Nearest Neighbours prediction

The third project involved building a spam classifier based off the Naive-Bayes approach.
